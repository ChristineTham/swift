# Introduction

No looking back now.

You've come to this tutorial because you want to learn Swift, Apple's new
programming language for making iOS and MacOS apps. This tutorial is bringing
together various resources to swiftly (ha!) and thoroughly introduce each
component of the Swift Programming Language.

There was an initial frenzy of excitement around the new language in June when
Apple introduced Swift at WWDC 2014. Since then, the various beta bugs and the
fact that no devices supported apps built in Swift has led to a bit of a
decline in Swift's popularity. Well Swift is now in release 1.0 and iOS8 will
soon be in the hands of millions of developers and consumers alike. There has
never been a better time to dive into Swift.

# A note on this tutorial

Swift is in its infancy. This tutorial is going to evolve and change as we
learn more about the language and the applications of the concepts we cover. We
are also constantly looking for more and better resources for each topic. With
that in mind, you can find the [raw markdown for this tutorial][github link]
over at Github. If you find good Swift resources that aren't mentioned here,
feel free to submit a pull request!

We'd like to give a special thanks to the great folks over at
[Swiftcast](http://www.swiftcast.tv/) for kick-starting this tutorial.  If you
have any questions or comments tweet them at
[@SwiftCastTV][swiftcast tweet link]!


## Prerequisites

To work through this tutorial you'll need a fully functioning Apple developer
setup. This includes


{x: running_osx}
A mac running OSX Mavericks or Yosemite

{x: apple_dev}
An [Apple developer account][apple_dev]

{x: copy_of_xcode}
A copy of Xcode 6

## Resources

We expect a plethora of learning resources to come out for Swift now that the
language is out of beta. Luckily, many resources are already available and this
heavily leverages the following (and they are all free!):

* The Swift Programming Language ebook from Apple (also available on iBooks)
* The MadApper Swift Video Series
* The Skip Wilson Swift Video Series

## One Last Thing

This entire tutorial can be done in a playground: an interactive environment
that exists in xcode that allows you to code and receive immediate results from
your code without having to compile an app. Before actually learning about
Swift, learn how to create and navigate around playgrounds.


{x: playgrounds}
Read [Exploring and Evaluating Swift Code in a Playground][playgrounds]


# Swift Basics

Now you are going to dive into the language itself. The goal of this section is
to get a handle on the syntax, operators, and data types in Swift.

## Swift Syntax

When learning a new language syntax, it is recommended that you immediately
start writing in the language as much as possible. Apple's "A Swift Tour"
chapter of The Swift Programming Guide provides an overview of Swift Syntax
as well as a set of "experiments", short exercises that let you write some
Swift code focusing on a different aspect of the Swift Syntax.


{x: variables_constants}
[Variables and Constants][variables_constants]

### Readings

Along with the experiments in the Swift ebook, we are including two blog posts
about reserved words and operators that can serve as reference materials.


{x: chapter_tour}
Read the [A Swift Tour][chapter_tour] chapter in the Swift ebook and work through the experiments.

{x: solutions}
[Check your solutions to experiments][solutions] and make any corrections.

{x: operators}
Read [about Swift operators][operators]

{x: reserved_words}
Read [about Swift Reserved Words][reserved_words]. Don't worry about memorizing these, just be aware.

{x: swift_js}
Optional: [Swift for Javscript Developers][swift_js] - We know many of you are coming from Javascript. Once you look a the Swift syntax you're going to see some similarities, so it is worth it to view the video and blog post by JP Simard on Swift for Javascript developers. JP goes over the key differences between the two languages as well as some similarities.

## Swift Types

If you've made it this far you've read that one of the good parts about Swift
is that it is a type-safe language. Even without having any idea what that
means, you can probably assume the section in this tutorial about types is
important. For learning about types, the MadApper video series and Apple's
documentation pair nicely. Types in Swift can be confusing because there are
four categories of types: named types, compound types, value types, and
reference types.  Each type in Swift is a compound type or a named type as well
as either a reference type or a value type.  Confused yet? No worries, we'll
sort all of this out.

### Pre-Readings

For Types, do the readings first before watching the videos on the specific
types.

## Extensions

We can take all of our knowledge of the various data types in Swift and give
them new functionality. Extensions allow us to give types new methods to suit
the needs of our applications. For this, watch a long and awesome video on
creating an extension and don't forget only named types can be extended.


{x: extensions}
[Extensions][extensions]

## Readings


{x: chapter_extensions}
Read the [Extensions][chapter_extensions] chapter in the Swift book.


# Control Flow

Okay now things get exciting. We are going to cover optionals, loops,
functions, and closures. These concepts allow us to allow our code to do things
only under certain conditions. Armed with this knowledge and what you've
learned so far, you will be able to write code more concisely and you'll even
be able to write the logic for basic games.

## Loops and Conditionals

Control flow constructs in Swift allow us to iterate over collections, loop
through a chunk of code multiple times, and execute code based on conditional
statements. The MadApper series does a good job of covering these concepts


{x: for}
[For (condition, increment) Loops][for]

{x: for_in}

{x: while}
[While Loops][while]

{x: do_while}
[Do While Loops][do_while]

{x: if}
[If][if]

{x: switch}
[Switch][switch]

## Optionals

Optional are a concept that is introduced in Swift and has no parallel in C or
Objective-C. Using them effectively can prevent some common programming errors
and increase the type safety of your code.


{x: chapter_basics}
[Optionals][chapter_basics]

### Readings


{x: optionals_basics}
Read the [section called "Optionals"][optionals_basics] in "The Basics Chapter" of the Swift ebook.

{x: optionals_complete_guide}
Read [The Complete Guide to Understanding Swift Optionals][optionals_complete_guide] to complete 
your understanding of optionals. Learn how they work under the hood, best pratices, and why we
need them in the first place.  

{x: swift_defines_away}
Read ["How Swift "Defines Away" Common Programming Errors…sort of"][swift_defines_away] by Matt Bridges

{x: optionals_case}
Read ["Optional Case Study: Value for Keys"][optionals_case] from the Swift Blog

## Functions and Closures

Functions and Closures are self-contained blocks of code functionality. That is
a vague explanation because functions and closures have very broad uses and can
take many forms. For this section, jump in with two long (and excellent) video
tutorials from Skip Wilson to get a practical crash course.


{x: functions}
[Functions][functions]

{x: closures}
[Closures][closures]

Functions and closures can take many forms in Swift. The difference between a
function and a closure can also be hard to grasp. The videos cover the
basics, but these readings will give you a more complete understanding.


{x: chapter_functions}
Read [the Functions chapter][chapter_functions] in the Swift ebook.

{x: chapter_closures}
Read [the Closures chapter][chapter_closures] in the Swift ebook.

{x: basic_functions_closures}
Read [A Basic Tutorial on Functions and Closures in Swift][basic_functions_closures] for clarification on functions, closures, and closure expressions.

{x: function_cheatsheet}
For reference, read [The Many Forms of Swift Functions][function_cheatsheet] to see all of the various form functions can take in Swift.

{x: closure_choke}
Finally [Enough About Swift Closures to Choke a Horse][closure_choke] shows the flexibility of Swift in writing closures.


# Object Oriented Programming

Objective-C is an object-oriented programming language. Swift preserves many of
the object-oriented ideas and constructs from Objective-C and you'll need to be
comfortable with these concepts to write apps in Swift.


{x: structs}
[Structs][structs]

{x: enums}
[Enums][enums]

{x: classes}
[Classes][classes]

{x: protocols}
[Protocols][protocols]

## Readings

Methods, Properties, and Initializers were covered in the videos, but the Swift
ebook is a good place to get a detailed explanation of each of those ideas.

There is an array of libraries to use for testing. Whether your flavor is BDD
or just plain old TDD there is something for everyone!

* [Sleipinr][sleiphinr_repo] is a BDD style testing framework for Swift.
* [Quick][quick_repo] is another BDD style testing framework for Swift.
* [Nimble][nilble_repo] is a compliment to Quick. It's a Matchers framework.


# SDK's

When it comes to actually building apps in Swift, it is paramount to get an
understanding of the various SDKs provided by Apple to get a sense for all of
deep functionality that Apple provides for developers and to prevent yourself
from trying to write code for functionality that already exists in an SDK or
library. In fact, we recommend always looking for a trusted library before
embarking on writing your own functionality (except, of course, if you're
writing it yourself to better learn Swift).

## Sprite Kit

Sprite Kit gives developers the ability to create simple or advanced 2D games
by providing animation and physics functionality.
